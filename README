This is PHP class for parsing Classification of Estonian administrative units and settlements xml
provided by http://metaweb.stat.ee/
It currently parses only counties, cities and rural municipalities into array. No villages and small towns. 
What it parses can be seen here too http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_haldusjaotus. 

Blog post about this class can be found http://eagerfish.eu/estonian-ehak-xml-parser-written-in-php/
Working example can be found here http://eagerfish.eu/projects/php-ehak-xml-parser/examples/javascript-filtering-example/

Keep in mind: 
* Use it however you want.
* Use at your own risk. No warranties are offered. 
* This is version 1.0.1

To get example working you need to add xml file into "input-xml" folder. 
Grab it from http://metaweb.stat.ee/ (direct link to current version http://metaweb.stat.ee/get_classificator_file.htm?id=2999171&siteLanguage=en_US)

After getting XML file find fallowing string from "examples/javascript-filtering-example/index.php": 
$inputXmlPath = '../../input-xml/EHAK2011v1_en.xml';
Change location of the file if needed to fit downloaded xml filename.

After that it should work.
